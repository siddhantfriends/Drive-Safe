# Drive Safe

## Introduction

There is a lot of improvements in technology over the years but the road trafic safety has not improved along with the technology. To improve the user experience of driving we want to create an application. This application will **measure the speed** at which the user is driving and **compare** it with the server in **real time**. If the user is **exceeding the speed limit** the user will be **informed to slow down**.

This simple idea could open a wide range of possiblities. While driving, your maps and the speed limits of the roads will be cached up to 50 miles around the driver. This will allow the driver to get notifications even when he is offline within the cached area. The traffic speed limits are the maximum limits at which a driver could drive. These cannot be varied when there is a bad weather, maintenance work on roads, traffic jams or snow. This variance in speed limits could be introduced in this application.

## Scope

1. Drivers can use this application to ensure maximum safety.
2. Traffic management agencies like [Highways England](http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic-information/) and [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) could manage the speed limits according to weather conditions.
3. Insurance agencies can use the data to provide **better premiums** to **safe drivers**.
4. Reduced accidents! :)
