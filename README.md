# Drive Safe

## Introduction

Over the years, technology has improved drastically, but we feel that road traffic safety has not kept up with these technological advancements. To improve the user experience of driving we want to create an application which will **measure the speed** at which the user is driving and **compare** it a server in **real time**. If the user is **exceeding the speed limit** the user will be **informed to slow down**.

This simple idea could open a wide range of possiblities. Whilst driving, your maps and the speed limits of the roads will be cached up to 50 miles around the driver, which will allow the driver to get notifications even when he is offline. In current navigation systems that compare vehicle speeds with the speed limits on the road, other environmental factors are not taken into account. The speed limits cannot be varied when there is bad weather, maintenance work on roads or traffic jams. Drive Safe however will use these external factors to give varied, updated speed limits, to try and improve safety on the roads.

## Scope

1. Drivers can use this application to ensure maximum safety.
2. Traffic management agencies like [Highways England](http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic-information/) and [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) could manage the speed limits according to weather conditions.
3. Insurance agencies can use the data to provide **better premiums** to **safe drivers**.
4. Reduced accidents! :)
